                </strong>
                Doctor of Medicine and participant of the modern cosmonaut rehabilitation program died on April 22, 2018 at the age of 89. Starting from 1959, Bueno worked as a surgeon at the the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Academy of Sciences for 30 years and was involved in space medicine. Many of his research projects were devoted to alternative medicine. Professor Mariano Bueno spent many years in attempts to develop a NATURAL remedy that would be able to penetrate into the joints and cartilage tissues, restoring them from the inside.

        <p>  In  <span class="nowyear" data-decrease="1">2018</span>  the research team led by Professor Mariano Bueno conducted a series of laboratory tests on an innovative medicament for joints. The results exceeded their expectations. After comparing the new drug with popular pharmacy products, the scientists had no doubt left that a new era in Rheumatology was coming!                         The researchers applied for certification of the drug and wanted it to be put into mass production. But then a tragedy happened - Professor Mariano Bueno passed away. Is there a chance that the product will still be launched?                         Our correspondent addressed this question to the chief rheumatologist of the Philippines Aweng Daclan who also took an important part in the research.  </p>

        <p class="font_text_p"><b> Correspondent: Good afternoom, Dr. Daclan. In what development stage is the remedy now? </b></p>
        <p><b class="font_text_p"> Aweng Daclan:  </b>  Good afternoon! I am pleased to inform you that after all the tests, permission was obtained for introducing the drug into the pharmaceutical market. The remedy is called Easy GO. This is exactly what it provides – its components are so beneficial to the joints that your movements will no longer cause you pain and discomfort. You will really start to move freely! </p>
        <p> Clinical trials of Easy GO have shown its high effectiveness in the treatment of joints. According to the most conservative estimates, this drug extends the lifespan of people suffering from joint diseases by at least 10 years!  </p>
        <p class="font_text_p"><b> Correspondent: Dr. Daclan, could you tell us what makes Easy GO stand out from the usual pharmacy products? </b></p>
        <p><b class="font_text_p"> Aweng Daclan:  </b>  As a rule, patients with joint diseases are prescribed one of the following drugs:

        <p>Some of them are really capable of relieving pain, but for the most part they provide a temporary effect. In fact, they only relieve pain rather than treating the disease and stopping the degenerative processes.                     Moreover, long-term use of such drugs destroys the kidneys, liver and stomach. Basically, it is a vicious circle, where the patient is forced to constantly use a medicament that adversely affects the body to reduce pain, while the cause of this pain is not cured. This is despite the fact that joint diseases are extremely serious may lead to devastating consequences such as cancerous tumors.</p>
        <p> Let me tell you what complications joint disease may lead to. The most common diseases of the joints usually develop in the following way:  </p>

        <p> As you can see, joint diseases very often lead to serious complications that are fraught with disability or even death. For the last 100 years, the load on the human skeleton has been continuously growing. As a result, almost every person older than 25 has at least 1-2 affected joints. By the age of 35-40, the disease progresses into a stage fraught with severe complications.  <br> <br>

            For illustrative purposes, you can look at these photos taken in hospitals:

        <p>  Now let's get this conversation back on a more or less positive track. Like many other medical scientists, Professor Mariano Bueno spent decades studying alternative medicine. He was especially interested in the secrets of longevity and health. We teamed up to use the best of Professor's knowledge and research experience in the formula of  <strong> Easy GO</strong>. The natural ingredients of Easy GO have proven to be the KEY factor in the treatment by providing  <strong> healthy blood supply to the affected joint</strong>. All you need is ensure the restoration of blood supply to stop the necrosis and inflammation and start the process of regeneration. The problem is that it sounds easy, but in practice it was not possible to implement using any of the existing treatment options. Luckily, Easy GO was created. Moreover, after the completion of clinical trials, it is available  <b> for just  <span class="x_currency">₱1,990</span>  as part of a special program. </b></p>
        <p> Before the drug was selected for distribution under the program, large-scale clinical trials were conducted. A total of 10,120 people suffering from various diseases of the joints from different age groups  took part in the trials. 93.8% fully cured their disease. 5.6% still have some problems, but in general their condition has improved significantly. Roughly speaking, test subjects who had a severe form of arthritis and could barely walk ended up with periodic light pains in the joint after undergoing a course of treatment. Only 0.6% of test subjects saw some improvements that were significant, but not significant enough to say they have completely recovered.  </p>

In memory of Professor Mariano Bueno, we organized a foundation named after him, received sponsorship funding, and launched a program for joint recovery.

        <p><strong class="font_text_p"> Correspondent: Pretty impressive! Could you explain what it means for ordinary people with joint diseases? </strong></p>
        <p><b class="font_text_p">  Aweng Daclan:  </b> This means that modern medicine of the Phillipines has made a major breakthrough, and you will be able to cure your disease at home in one to two months. Easy GO is not an analgesic. It "restarts" the body at the cellular level. It eliminates the cause of the disease and restores the joints and spine to their original, healthy condition. The patient not only gets rid of symptoms, but eliminates the root cause of the disease by improving blood supply to cartilage that was previously weakened by slow, old cells. </p>
        <p> Starting from day one, Easy GO starts the process of body regeneration.     It relieves pain too, so you will immediately feel its action. In just two or three weeks, regeneration will be complete. </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong class="font_text_p"> Correspondent: Does Easy GO help only when you have certain diseases of the joints? </strong></p>
        <p><b class="font_text_p"> Aweng Daclan:  </b>  No. I'm telling you: it acts at the cellular level by stimulating the processes of regeneration. It treats absolutely any disease of the joints and spine including arthrosis, arthritis, osteoporosis, rheumatism, gout, sciatica, radiculitis, osteochondrosis, displacement of vertebral discs, and many others. It treats any diseases of the joints at any stage.  </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong class="font_text_p"> Correspondent: Does the gel really eliminate all of these diseases rather than just relieving the pain? </strong></p>
        <p><b class="font_text_p"> Aweng Daclan:  </b> Easy GO both eliminates the pain (in the initial stages of treatment) and completely cures the disease. Of course there are other way of treatment of these diseases, but as a rule they are all associated with surgery and are very dangerous. Not to mention the fact that the cost of a knee surgery is incredibly high and a very small number of people can afford it.  </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong class="font_text_p"> Correspondent: How can people get Easy GO for  <span class="x_currency">₱1,990</span>?     Who is eligible? </strong></p>
        <p><b class="font_text_p"> Aweng Daclan:  </b> Absolutely anyone can order it. There is only one thing - because of small volumes of production, there is a limited number of items for sale under the program. At the same time, anyone can fill in the request form and get Easy GO for just  <span class="x_currency">₱1,990</span>. All you need is provide your name and phone number. You will be contacted via this phone number by an operator of our consulting center.  </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong class="font_text_p"> Correspondent: What is the time frame of the program? </strong></p>
        <p><b class="font_text_p"> Aweng Daclan:  </b> The promotional progam ends on  <strong><font color="red"><span><script type="text/javascript">dtime_nums(0, true)</script></span></font></strong>
            (inclusive). All you need to do is  <span class="toform"> place your order via the website</span>.     If you haven't done so, I recommend you hurry up because it will be impossible to by the gel for <span class="x_currency">₱1,990</span> after that. I personally guarantee that all requests placed until that time will be processed and people will receive the drug.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong class="font_text_p"> Dr. Daclan, thank you for the interview! Would you like to say something to our readers before we wrap up the interview? </strong></p>
        <p><b class="font_text_p"> Aweng Daclan:  </b> Yes, certainly. I would like to draw the readers' attention to the fact that diseases of the back and joints affect younger people these days, and even weak periodic pain is a sufficient reason to pay attention to the problem. The doctors will hardly try to persuade you to undergo treatment. Your health is in your own hands. </p>
        <p> And remember: diseases that occur due to pain in the back and joints are more than just a source of discomfort. They shorten your life by 15-20 years. </p>

I had radiculitis and couldn't move without pain. I totally lost hope at some point. I'm grateful to my mother, because she discovered Easy GO and made me try it. She's a big fan of Professor Mariano Bueno and his research on alternative medicine. She closely followed all his methods, and ordered Easy GO as soon as it was launched on the website I was skeptical at first, but in fact it cured me of my back pain and I can move freely now. Believe me, just try it and everything will be fine, you'll see it.

                    Thank you. Easy GO helped me really quickly. I ordered it from the official website while it was on promotion. Do not delay your treatment, it is better to get rid of all these problems with your joints now than then to be laid low and realise that you will never be able to walk without pain.

                    Thank you, Dr. Daclan, and may Professor Mariano Bueno rest in peace. If not for you, I would have never believed that joint diseases can in fact be cured. My husband had degenerative disc disease for 15 years, so I know exactly what it is like. Motio Free cured him completely! The interesting thing is, he didn't even notice how the low back pain was gone! And the package to  <span class="geocity"></span>  arrived so quickly.

                    Dr. Daclan, it took about 15 days. After 20 days of treatment I noticed that his pain was fully gone.

                <div class="vk-comment-text"> I accidentally came across this article. And what do I see! You are talking about my favourite balm. I mean that I bought them for my husband some time ago. He has no idea I'm posting a comment here, but I will share it with you anyway. Because it makes me so happy! In short, I once read a ton of reviews, considered buying the balm and finally ordered them. Because my husband kind of lost all hope. He took some drugs but those caused stomach problems. We didn't know what to do. And then he tried Easy GO — and voila! My beloved husband is healthy again, he is active and full of energy! We managed to get it for only  <span class="x_currency">₱1,990</span>!
